		<br>
		Previous versions of Diver traced all interactions during the
		execution of your program. With Diver 0.3, it is now possible to
		apply class and package filters at runtime. This will decrease
		the size of your traces and increase the responsiveness of your
		running software, and significantly decrease the amount of time
		that it takes Diver to analyze the trace after you have finished
		the trace. However, it will also increase the memory consumption
		of the the program that you are tracing. Also, Diver's 
		&quot;Reanalyze Trace&quot; feature will not be as effective.</p>

	<tr valign=top>
		<td><b>Sequence Diagram Filtering</b></td>
		<td><p>You can now apply the filters from the Program Traces View to the Thread Sequence View. 
		There is now an &quot;eye&quot; <img src="images/new/0.3.0/openeye.png"> icon visible in the
		sequence diagram view. Close the eye to apply they filter. The default application of this
		action is to &quot;grey out&quot; method calls that are &quot;unnecessary&quot; according to
		the filters that you have defined in the Program Traces View:<br><br>
		<img src="images/new/0.3.0/sequence-filter1.png"/></p>
		<p>Use the <i>Hide Unnecessary Calls</i> action from the Thread Sequence View's menu to hide
		the method calls altogether:<br><br>

		feature is featured on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzMl4Zu2tps">Youtube</a>.
		Note that this feature will not work on your current traces until after you reanalyze
		them. See the <a href='docs/Diver.html#GainingaDifferentPerspective'>documentation</a>
		for more information.</p></td>

		<td><b>Package Explorer Coloring</b></td>
		<td><p>The package explorer filters in Diver work not only for an entire
		 trace, but for the selected thread as well. That is, if you select a 
		 thread in the active trace, then only the methods invoked
		 by that thread are visible within the package explorer. In previous
		 versions, this could cause some confusion with respect to methods 
		 called from anonymous inner classes. For example, the method
		 <code>A.parent()</code> might declare an anonymous inner class called 
		 <code>A$1</code> with the method <code>child()</code>. Now, in the
		 package explorer, <code>A$1.child()</code> is shown as a child of
		 <code>A.parent()</code>, but it may be the case that 
		 <code>A$1.child()</code> is never called in the same thread as 
		 <code>A.parent()</code>. Diver handled this problem in previous versions
		 by displaying <code>A.parent()</code> even if it is not called
		 in the currently selected thread. Diver 0.3.0 attempts to alleviate
		 the confusion caused by this scenario by using colors in the package
		 explorer. If an element (package, java file, class, method) is not
		 executed in the selected thread, but one of its descendents (method,
		 inner class, etc.) is, then that element is colored in grey:
