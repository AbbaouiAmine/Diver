<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Diver is an extensive set of tools that brings advanced software analysis right into your 
Eclipse IDE. There is a long list of features, and here are a few highlights. See the 
<a href="docs/Diver.html">documentation</a> for a more extensive list of features, and how
to use them.</p>

<h3>It's Free</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Many tools like this may cost you a lot of money to use. But Diver is 100% free and open source. Diver represents years
	of research and development, and you can use it for free.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Trace Your Java Programs</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a onClick="screenshot('images/launching/launch3.png')">Just run it</a>. It is as easy as any launch in Eclipse. Simply create a new trace
	configuration and hit <i>Run</i>.</li>
	<li><strong>Or debug it</strong>. You can launch in debug mode as well, and trace only when
	you hit breakpoints.</li>
	<li><a onclick="screenshot('images/launching/debugview.jpg')">Control the trace</a>. You can pause and restart a trace at any time. A simple button in
	the Debug View gives you complete control.</li>
	<li><a onclick="screenshot('images/launching/traceconfig.png')">See it in different ways</a>. You can filter your trace so that it only logs
	the classes and packages that you are interested in. Most other tools force you to commit to this
	at the start. Diver, though, lets you change your mind at <a onclick="screenshot('images/code/reanalyze.png')">any time</a>, so you
	can see your trace from different perspectives.</li>
	<li><a onclick="screenshot('images/launching/eclipselaunch.png')">Launch Eclipse applications</a>. Trace support for Eclipse is also included.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Visualize Your Traces</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a onclick="screenshot('images/diving/program traces.png')">List your traces</a>. Diver traces are stored outside of the
	workspace, and automatically indexed and viewed so that you can gain quick access to them.</li>
	<li><a onclick="screenshot('images/diving/sequencediagram-simple.png')">Sequence Diagrams</a>. Visualize your trace using an
	advanced, fast, and attractive sequence diagram visualization, that is directly linked with your source code.</li>
	<li><strong>Hide what you don't want</strong>. Many of the elements in the sequence diagram can be collapsed or expanded
	to reveal only the things that you want to see. This includes <a onclick="screenshot('images/diving/sequence-package-collapse.png')">
	 lifelines</a>, activation boxes, and
	 <a onclick="screenshot('images/diving/sequence-block-collapse.png')">groups</a> of related messages.</li>
	<li><a onclick="screenshot('images/code/timeline0.png')">See it in time</a>. Diver not only shows you <i>what</i>
	has occurred, but also, <i>when</i> it occurred. Diver gives you a timeline that allows you to filter your diagram and
	quickly understand when and why method calls happened.</li>
	<li><a onclick="screenshot('images/diving/sequence-loop-iteration.png')">Compress loops</a>. Rather than showing you
	repeated calls thousands of times, Diver compresses loops into coherent groups, and does so <i>using your source code</i>.
	So you can not only see that messages were repeated, but also <i>why</i> they were.</li>
	<li><strong>Saving state</strong>. Your diagram state is automatically saved as you explore it, so the next time you
	open it, you won't have to try and search again.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Understand Your Code</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>See the code</strong>. Nearly all elements in the visualizations are linked directly back to source code.
	Just double click, and see the source.</li>
	<li><a onclick="screenshot('images/code/sourcecode.png')">Read the code</a>. Diver offers a <i>code coverage</i> feature
	which will let you see what lines of code were called, right in your source code view.</li>
	<li><a onclick="screenshot('images/code/filtercompare.png')">Unclutter your Java views</a>. Diver offers advanced filters
	that will limit your package explorer to showing only those elements that appear in your trace.</li>
	<li><a onclick="screenshot('images/code/layer1.png')">Compare use cases</a>. Ever wonder what the difference was between two
	different runs of the same program? Diver will show you.</li>
</ul>
