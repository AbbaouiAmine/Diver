<h3>News!</h3>
<p><b><br>October 27, 2011</b> <i>New Update Sites</i></p>
<p>Today, we released new update sites. Both of these are available through the
<a href='download.html'>Download</a> page. They should be faster and more reliable
than the previous update sites, but if you find they aren't, let us know!</p>

<p><b><br>August 5, 2011</b> <i>New Version of Diver</i></p>
<p>Today, we released version 0.4.0 of Diver. There are a few new features, and
a number of bug fixes. Several of the features are considered <i>Beta</i>.
Diver, really, is a beta project, but the beta features are
a little "more" beta than the rest :-). See the <a href='new.html'>New To Diver</a>
page for more information.</p>

<p><b><br>March 21, 2011</b> <i>Diver is a runner-up for Best Developer Tool at EclipseCon!</i></p>
<p>It was announced at EclipseCon that Diver was the runner-up for best 
developer tool of 2011. This honour was bestowed upon us by a panel of judges
belonging to the Eclipse Foundation. We here at the CHISEL group strive to
create tools that work well and help people. We are humbled by the numerous other
tools that were also nominated, and we would like to congratulate the winner.</p>

<p><b>November 24, 2010</b> <i>New Version of Diver</i></p>
<p>Version 0.3.0 is out today. See the <a href='new_0_3_0.html'>New To Diver</a> page 
for a list of new features. The data collection period of our studies are over,
so Diver will no longer collect usage information. Go to the 
<a href='download.html'>Download</a> page for information about how to get Diver.</p>
<p><b>May 17, 2010</b> <i>New Version of Diver</i></p>
<p>Version 0.2.0 of Diver was released today. See <a href='new_0_2_0.html'>New To Diver</a>.
Note that with version 0.2.0, Diver will log usage information by default. You
can opt out, and turn it off if you wish.</p>
<p><b>Jan 27, 2010</b> <i>New Version of Diver</i></p>
<p>Version 0.1.0 of Diver is now out. See the <a href='new_0_1_0.html'>New To Diver</a> page
to see what you can get.</p>
<p><b>Dec 2, 2009</b> <i>Diver Now Available on Linux!</i>*</p>
<p>The Diver native code has been compiled to work on Linux. It isn't currently
in the main Release stream, but you can test it out using the Developer 
releases:
<strong>https://diver.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/diver/Development</strong></p>

<h3>Diver Is Research</h3>
<p>Diver is a part of ongoing research at the 
<a href='http://www.thechiselgroup.org'>Computer Human Interaction Software Engineering Lab</a> (CHISEL)
at the <a href='http://www.uvic.ca/'>University of Victoria</a>. Please see the 
<a href='research.html'>research</a> page for more info.</p>
<p>As of Diver version 0.2.0, we are logging usage information about how Diver is
used. If you would like to use Diver, but not have any of the information about
how you are using Diver logged, you can shut off the logging facilities using
the Eclipse preferences.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environment:</strong> Eclipse SDK, version 3.5 with the Java Development Tools (JDT) installed.</li>
<li><strong>Java:</strong> Java SDK version 6 or higher</li>
<li><strong>Operating System:</strong> Linux, Windows XP SP2 or later*</li>
</ul>

<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Processor:</strong> Multi-core system</li>
<li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2GB of RAM or higher</li>
<li><strong>Permanent Storage:</strong> 20GB or higher available to store trace data</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>*NOTE</strong>: Diver uses native C++ code. Currently, it has only been tested on systems running
Windows XP and Windows 7. Preliminary testing has been done on the Linux
operating system as well, but it is not part of the regular release.
The code is portable, and there is no theoretical reason that it can't run on any
Java 6-enabled environment. If you would like to help us to expand the number of platforms that Diver can run on,
please visit the Diver <a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/diver'>project</a> page and contribute.</p>
